## About me
Hi there, my name is João Victor Laitano Coelho.
I was raised and I'm currently living in [SC-Florianópolis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florian%C3%B3polis), south of Brazil.
Graduated at UFSC in Electrical Engineering, and now I'm doing a masters degree.
I've been working as a data scientist at an up and coming startup for the last two years.

## Now
- Currently my studies in machine learning have been about Reinforcement Learning.
- I'm learning a little about web development so I can start this blog up.
- Currently doing a masters degree at UFSC, focusing more on machine learning and digital signal processing.
