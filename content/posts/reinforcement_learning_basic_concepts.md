## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning is a sub-area of machine learning with main focus on algorithms that learn **which is the best action to take given a specific situation**

The learning happens through a sequence of actions that the algorithm takes by trial and error getting some rewards at each trial. However the actions not only affect the imediate reward but the next rewards as well. In this way reinforcement learning can be thought as another machine learning paradigm which held the main differeces as:

- Learning by trial and error.
- Delayed reward.
- Each action influences future states.
